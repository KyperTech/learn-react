## Webpack
> Project building + Live Reload Development

Webpack explanation - How Webpack creates a bundle and allows for loaders and module hot loading


## Redux
> State Management

In order for your components to communicate among themselves, we will need some sort of data management (often called state management). Redux is considered one of the best overall state managers, especially when using with React and redux-router.

Don't worry too much about hoping into writing Redux code by yourself because there are tons of examples and generators

## Yeoman
> Generator framework

Instead of copying a ton of files to start or work on a project Yeoman takes the approach of "generating" files/folders based on input provided by a user within the terminal. This is particularly useful for projects that contain large amounts of standard functionality.

We will be using a generator to get started making our application so that we begin with a basic application that has Webpack, React, and Redux setup in a simple app and ready to use. The generator also has "sub-generators" that will help us easily add to our project.
